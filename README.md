# Task2
Titanic Classification (using supervised learning)
The "Titanic Survival Prediction Model using Machine Learning" project aims to develop a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the RMS Titanic based on various demographic and social factors. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data of Titanic passengers, identify patterns, and predict survival outcomes.
